# Data Clustering using K-means

K-means clustering is one of the simplest and most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques to partition observed data into $k$ clusters. You can find more detailed on K-means clustering here:  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#k-means

In the `kmeans.ipynb` notebook, I show how this algorithm can be used to cluster solar cells based on their power conversion efficiency and better understand the impact of different parameters on their performance.
